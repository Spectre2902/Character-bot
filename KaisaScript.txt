Kaisa: Are you the hunter... or the prey?
Kaisa: You wouldn't last a day in the Void.
Kaisa: Here is where we make our stand. Do as I say, it's the only way if we want to live.
Kaisa: This suit lives on me, it calls me home. We survive together.
Kaisa: You know that feeling when your skin crawls? Like a thousand needles poking through every pore? Blood pounding through every vein? That's just an itch compared to what lives on me.
Kaisa: The first time I returned from the Void, it was to save me. Now it's to save them.
Kaisa: Stay with me, and we live.
Kaisa: When memories fade and darkness surrounds you... find the strength inside.
Kaisa: My appearance may frighten you, but make no mistake: I am on your side, and we fight to the bitter end.
Kaisa: Huh... memories of my father come at the strangest moments.
Kaisa: Reunions can be so bittersweet.
Kaisa: Could it... be true?
Kaisa: It smells like home here.
Kaisa: Father?
Kaisa: Come with me if you wanna live.
Kaisa: The Void has breached this place.
Kaisa: The first wave is upon us.
Kaisa: These creatures seek the living... even here.
Kaisa: That smell... unmistakable... the Void.
Kaisa: I came for the hunt... but I'll stay for the fruit.
Kaisa: I like it here, I just might stay.
Kaisa: This skin lives on me, and hunts with me.
Kaisa: Feed the beast... or be its meal.
Kaisa: I was spared for a reason.
Kaisa: Forgiveness is hard, but so very worth it.
Kaisa: I return stronger than I left.
Kaisa: Exploit their weakness.
Kaisa: A moving target lives longer.
Kaisa: I can make a difference here.
Kaisa: I will make a difference here.
Kaisa: This place is beautiful, I'm going to save it.
Kaisa: This skin is fashioned for survival, and honed by instinct.
Kaisa: It's a good day for a hunt.
Kaisa: I came back for the others who could not.
Kaisa: Hold our ground, attack them in theirs.
Kaisa: Void rule number one, don't die.
Kaisa: Exploit their mistakes.
Kaisa: Survival means never stopping, the Void knows that too.
Kaisa: This suit hunts in the manner I choose.
Kaisa: It's fight or flight, only now I do not run.
Kaisa: Stay alert, stay aggressive.
Kaisa: This world is changing... we decide into what.
Kaisa: Monsters are everywhere.
Kaisa: Ah, trees... How I missed them.
Kaisa: Danger is real, fear is an illusion.
Kaisa: Imagine a place where it's always night and you're holding faith for a dawn that never comes. I don't have to imagine. I've been there.
Kaisa: The skin grows restless... it needs to feed. If it doesn't, could I be next?
Kaisa: Anger is useless to me, a wound that will only continue to fester.
Kaisa: I am the antidote, for the rivers of poison flowing beneath us all.
Kaisa: I kill so they don't die!
Kaisa: I am not afraid!
Kaisa: I'll be your monster!
Kaisa: Power, not hate.
Kaisa: Hit and move!
Kaisa: I survived the Void, but here is where my story has its best ending.
Kaisa: Get up, stand firm, strike hard.
Kaisa: I won't back down!
Kaisa: The Void will not consume me, but I must act or the others will not be as lucky.
Kaisa: The hunt is on!
Kaisa: I can make a difference here.
Kaisa: Strike hard!
Kaisa: Just for you!
Kaisa: You're nothing.
Kaisa: One mistake is all it takes.
Kaisa: When I was a child I was frightened of what lurked in the dark. How silly I was. Now, I call it home.
Kaisa: This is why I came back!
Kaisa: Tell yourself you will live. Believe it, Kai'Sa, and you will have a chance.
Kaisa: Love... fear... whatever it's called, it's survival that motivates everyone.
Kaisa: I can rid them of these monsters, but who will save them from themselves?
Kaisa: Let go of the anger. It does not serve.
Kaisa: Fear the Void's sting!
Kaisa: Come on, come on.
Kaisa: This is why I survived!
Kaisa: Thick skin always wins!
Kaisa: I'm back!
Kaisa: This place is too beautiful to be decimated by the Void.
Kaisa: My turn!
Kaisa: Back in your hole!
Kaisa: Only a child, and no one came to save me.
Kaisa: I won't quit!
Kaisa: Ahh, a cold breeze. I remember these. Reminds me of home.
Kaisa: Maybe someday they will come to accept me. For now, they will need me.
Kaisa: The Void consumes everything, leaving only emptiness in its wake.
Kaisa: My skin is crawling... the needles... the itch... time to hunt.
Kaisa: Fear me!
Kaisa: It's fight or flight, only now I do not run.
Kaisa: This skin taught me how to survive. I will show it how to live.
Kaisa: Look closely, and your prey will show you how to kill it.
Kaisa: The monsters are coming. We'll be ready. I'll make sure of it.
Kaisa: Survival is an instinct we all have.
Kaisa: I'll be back for more.
Kaisa: You're the hunted.
Kaisa: I wield the abyss!
Kaisa: Found your weakness!
Kaisa: peaches.
Kaisa: The hunt is binary, kill or be killed.
Kaisa: The hunting ground has changed... but the hunt is the same.
Kaisa: Like magnets, we are drawn to each other to do battle.
Kaisa: Just the beginning.
Kaisa: So this is what was before technology won? M'okay.
Kaisa: You don't know what you're doing.
Kaisa: I'm right here!
Kaisa: This second skin gave me a second life. I will not take it for granted.
Kaisa: Metal on metal. Let's get loud!
Kaisa: You're the prey!
Kaisa: Oh, how I like a fair fight.
Kaisa: You realize we should be on the same side?
Kaisa: I survived the Void. I refuse to let death in. I refuse to accept it as my fate.
Kaisa: They need to listen to me. Then they would see that I can show them a better way.
Kaisa: Attack!
Kaisa: My carbon fiber exoskeleton is invulnerable to micro-meteorites, re-entry, and the vacuum of space. It has but one flaw: it can be a tad itchy.
Kaisa: Come on, let's go!
Kaisa: Human or machine? Make up your mind.
Kaisa: Some recoil at the sight of me. Underneath the shell, would they see I'm just like them.
Kaisa: Kill!
Kaisa: Fire!
Kaisa: My suit will continue to learn with every kill.
Kaisa: Hextech is a dead technology.
Kaisa: Fight hard. You are a living weapon.
Kaisa: Deploy!
Kaisa: Technology doesn't evolve; it upgrades.
Kaisa: This skin is fashioned for survival, and honed by instinct.
Kaisa: Life and death are separated by the smallest stumble.
Kaisa: Engage!
Kaisa: They have found me here. Let's settle this.
Kaisa: Time for an upgrade, rusty.
Kaisa: Wow, time for an upgrade.
Kaisa: Time to pit steel against steel.
Kaisa: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe Or - ...Are those peaches?
Kaisa: Let's see what you're made of!
Kaisa: My suit hungers.
Kaisa: Foolish quarry!
Kaisa: Kai'Sa, remember the name.
Kaisa: This is my purpose, learn from me.
Kaisa: A lamp's not gonna do it, Jax.
Kaisa: I guess I'm next, Jax.
Kaisa: Settle down, sister.
Kaisa: You want crazy?
Kaisa: You talk too much.
Kaisa: Have we met?
Kaisa: You seem familiar.
Kaisa: Something is off here.
Kaisa: I know your tricks.
Kaisa: Don't test me.
Kaisa: You will leave this place.
Kaisa: What are you?
Kaisa: Not on my watch, glutton.
Kaisa: Vile creature...
Kaisa: Looking for me?
Kaisa: Let's set the story straight.
Kaisa: You call those guns?
Kaisa: You're outgunned.
Kaisa: Step back, red.
Kaisa: This is my home, Void-spawn!
Kaisa: You must be lost, creature...
Kaisa: Not here, friend.
Kaisa: Die, trespasser.
Kaisa: I am not afraid anymore.
Kaisa: Go back, 'Voidling'!
Kaisa: This is my home, Void-spawn.
Kaisa: This is not the Void!
Kaisa: You will die here, creature."
Kaisa: Come on, come on!
Kaisa: You don't belong here.
Kaisa: Agh, clumsy girl.
Kaisa: Close doesn't count.
Kaisa: Do better next time, Kai'Sa.
Kaisa: That was pointless.
Kaisa: They got lucky.
Kaisa: Dammit! Dammit!!
Kaisa: Damn it! Take your time, Kai'Sa.
Kaisa: I knew it.
Kaisa: Prepare for what's next.
Kaisa: Walked into that one.
Kaisa: They can't get away.
Kaisa: Gotcha!
Kaisa: Yes!
Kaisa: Marked by the Void.
Kaisa: Found you.
Kaisa: You're all mine.
Kaisa: Tag.
Kaisa: Mmm-hmm.
Kaisa: Too slow.
Kaisa: Perfect!
Kaisa: I am good.
Kaisa: That was easy.
Kaisa: Running is only half a plan.
Kaisa: That'll leave a mark.
Kaisa: Nice!
Kaisa: Prey marked.
Kaisa: I see you.
Kaisa: Revealed.
Kaisa: Got one!
Kaisa: They never saw it coming.
Kaisa: They'll think twice next time.
Kaisa: They can run, but they can't hide.
Kaisa: Yes!
Kaisa: The Void's reach is long.
Kaisa: Too late to run!
Kaisa: Only I can escape the Void.
Kaisa: You can't outrun the Void.
Kaisa: Coward!
Kaisa: I'll take that.
Kaisa: They were so close.
Kaisa: Almost made it!
Kaisa: I forgive you, Malzahar... but I do not forget.
Kaisa: You're now dead, prophet, that is the truth that will be told.
Kaisa: Goodbye, Malzahar, now I will tell this tale.
Kaisa: This is why they need me.
Kaisa: Will they now see? I can do this.
Kaisa: For you! For us!
Kaisa: Yes! We did it.
Kaisa: That's just the start.
Kaisa: That sent a message.
Kaisa: Mmm!
Kaisa: Sometimes you have to stop and taste the fruit.
Kaisa: Not peaches... but... they'll do.
Kaisa: Ohh, how I missed these.
Kaisa: What a pleasant surprise.
Kaisa: Sometimes you have to stop and taste the... Honeyfruit?
Kaisa: Let them come to us.
Kaisa: Vision can make all the difference.
Kaisa: They will come, we'll be ready.
Kaisa: All better now
Kaisa: Ah, that works.
Kaisa: Thanks for that.
Kaisa: I won't forget this.
Kaisa: I'll take it.
Kaisa: I needed that.
Kaisa: That is just what I needed.
Kaisa: Ahh, that's much better.
Kaisa: Yes! Teamwork!
Kaisa: Nice work.
Kaisa: Thanks.
Kaisa: Alright.
Kaisa: Whew.
Kaisa: Whew, that was close.
Kaisa: We're stronger together.
Kaisa: You are awesome.
Kaisa: Thanks.
Kaisa: Nice reflexes.
Kaisa: Whoa! Nice!.
Kaisa: Don't be long, we're stronger together.
Kaisa: Don't worry, I will fight alone. I've done it before.
Kaisa: I'll stand our ground while you're away.
Kaisa: Look what just crawled from underneath.
Kaisa: They're hiding.
Kaisa: Don't be fooled.
Kaisa: It's a trap. Be ready.
Kaisa: I need to gather my strength.
Kaisa: That's enough for the moment, the hunt will resume.
Kaisa: In the Void I had no one. I was a doomed outsider. Here, people are everywhere, and they are all mine.
Kaisa: Some call me 'monster,' they have no idea what lurks just below us all.
Kaisa: The Void is not so much a place ‒ it is a power, reaching out to consume all life.
Kaisa: The Void-spawn offer a thousand ways to die, and one way to live: become like them.
Kaisa: The things we carry should lift us up, not weigh us down. Memories, love, and hope are the lightest necessities.
Kaisa: The yoke of fear is a heavy burden. Hunters must be nimble, and walk lightly.
Kaisa: I grew up deep inside a vast emptiness, I do not wish to grow old in one. That is why we must fight.
Kaisa: Down there, I was surrounded by nothingness... but I was never alone. Memories comfort like the closest companion.
Kaisa: I'm here, I'm ready.
Kaisa: There's still time to make this right.
Kaisa: I'm not alone, I'm not afraid.
Kaisa: They wanna fight? I'll give 'em a fight!
Kaisa: Growing up means making your own hope."
Kaisa: Eyes on the horizon.
Kaisa: An oath is more than just words. It's a promise.
Kaisa: I will make a difference here. I have to.
Kaisa: What happened? How? I-I have to stop this
Kaisa: Oh, come on, Ina! That wasn't scary at all!
Kaisa: Got a death wish?
Kaisa: It's the only way!
Kaisa: I never liked you!
Kaisa: I won't fail!
Kaisa: I've trained for this!
Kaisa: You're not stopping me!
Kaisa: Close!
Kaisa: Urgh!
Kaisa: Damn!
Kaisa: Perfect!
Kaisa: Stay down!
Kaisa: Had to be done.
Kaisa: No time to rest.
Kaisa: Onto the next one!
Kaisa: More will come.
Kaisa: Not pretty, but I'll take it.
Kaisa: It never gets easier.
Kaisa: Nice. Another down
Kaisa: All right, let's go!
Kaisa: Thanks! Needed that.
Kaisa: Much better!
Kaisa: Ugh…
Kaisa: Take care of this…
Kaisa: I don't feel too good…
Kaisa: That's how I learn. Better get it right this time.
Kaisa: It hurts more than I expected.
